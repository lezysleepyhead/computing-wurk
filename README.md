[Intro: Jungkook]
'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight

[Verse 1: Jungkook]
Shoes on, get up in the morn'
Cup of milk, let's rock and roll
King Kong, kick the drum
Rolling on like a Rolling Stone
Sing song when I'm walking home
Jump up to the top, LeBron
Ding-dong, call me on my phone
Ice tea and a game of ping pong

[Pre-Chorus: RM, j-hope]
This is getting heavy, can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (Woo-hoo)
Life is sweet as honey, yeah, this beat cha-ching like money, huh
Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
I'm diamond, you know I glow up
Hey, so let's go

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (Hey)
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah-oh-oh


[Verse 2: V, RM]
Bring a friend, join the crowd, whoever wanna come along
Word up, talk the talk, just move like we off the wall
Day or night, the sky's alight, so we dance to the break of dawn (Hey)
Ladies and gentlemen, I got the medicine so you should keep ya eyes on the ball, huh

[Pre-Chorus: Suga, Jimin, RM]
This is getting heavy, can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (Woo-hoo)
Life is sweet as honey, yeah, this beat cha-ching like money, huh
Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
I'm diamond, you know I glow up
Let's go

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (Hey)
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, Jin]
Dyn-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, life is dynamite
Dyn-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, life is dynamite
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah-oh-oh

[Bridge: Jungkook, j-hope, Jimin, V]
Dyn-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, ayy
Dyn-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, ayy
Dyn-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, ayy
Light it up like dynamite
Dyn-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, ayy
Dyn-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, ayy
Dyn-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, ayy
Light it up like dynamite


[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, Jin]
'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite

(This is ah) 'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (Alight, oh)
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah-oh-oh (Light it up like dynamite)

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
Dyn-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, life is dynamite (Life is dynamite)
Dyn-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, life is dynamite (Oh)
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah-oh-oh
